CNS
Central Nervous System|The brain and spinal cord as well as the retina and optic nerves belong to the CNS
PNS
Peripheral Nervous System|The ganglia and nerve fibres from sensory recentors and to muscles and organs
Meninges
The brain and spinal cord are protected by three layers collectively known as meninges:|dura-mater: A thick leather-like inelastic layer present directly below the bone.||arachnoid-mater: A thin, delicate, middle layer present directly below the dura-mater. Has spider web like filamentous extensions into the sub-arachnoid space which reach the pia-mater||pia-mater: A thin, delicate, translucent layer that directly lines the gyri/sulci of the brain, and the spinal cord. Rich in blood-vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Functionally, it forms the blood brain barrier (BBB).
CSF
Cerebrospinal fluid|A pool of fluid cushioning the brain and spinal cord. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain. In the cranium (skull), the cerebrospinal fluid is present in the sub-arachnoid space, in between the arachnoid-mater and the pia-mater.
Brain regions during development
Forebrain (Prosencephalon) which can be further sub-divided into:| - Telencephalon: develops into the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampal formation, amygdala| - Diencephalon: gives rise to structures like the thalamus, hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.||Midbrain (Mesencephalon): tectum and tegmentum, which exist in all vertebrate brains. The tectum in the mammalian brain consists of the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus.||Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon): consists of the Metencephalon (develops into the pons, cerebellum) and the Myelencephalon (develops into the medulla oblongata)
Telencephalon Regions
The cerebral cortex (neocortex) is anatomically divided into 4 lobes||frontal lobe: comprises of the motor/pre-motor areas required for motor execution and other association areas required for cognition. The frontal lobe in humans specifically contains the language production centre (Brocas area) . Higher mammals such as primates (humans/great apes) have an additional lobe anterior to the frontal lobe known as the pre-frontal lobe which is responsible for higher order cognitive processing.||parietal lobe: separated from the frontal lobe by the central sulcus. Primary lobe for somatosensory processing (afferent inputs from receptors in the skin). Additionally, subserves other sensori-motor functions.||temporal lobe: separated from the frontal and parietal lobe by the lateral fissure (Sylvian fissure). Involved in auditory processing and language comprehension (Wernickes area). Additionally, responsible for visual object recognition. The medial portion of the temporal lobe includes a portion of the hippocampal formation which is involved in formation of new memories||occipital lobe: the most posterior part of the cerebral cortex which is involved in visual processing.
Diencephalon Regions
Thalamus: composed of several nuclei which act as relay stations to transmit information to and from neocortex.|Hypothalamus: required for regulation of autonomic bodily functions|Pituitary Gland: regulation of the endocrine (hormonal) system
Gray Matter vs White Matter
|Gray Matter: neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons which comprise local connections. In mammals, grey matter is organized into laminae (layers) and is termed the neocortex||White Matter: myelinated axons which comprise long-range inter-areal connections
corpus callosum

Proportion of neocortex and associated regions to the entire brain
80-85%
Number of nerve fibres carrying visual information out of the retina to the thalamus
1 million for each eye.
Meters of axon contained by 1mm^3 of gray matter and white matter
4'000m for gray matter, 9m for white matter
Neuron parts
From input to output neurons have 4 parts:|Dendrite|Soma|Axon|Synapse||Dendrites recieve input from other neurons and transmit these to the soma. The soma is the neuron nucleus and can fire resulting in a signal which is transmitted by the axon to the synapses which transmit the signals to further neurons.
Hyperpolarization
Neurons are hyperpolarized which means they have a resting potential of -70 mV within and 0 mV outside of them. Hyperpolarization refers to an increase in membrane potential whereas depolarization refers to a decrease in membrane potential
Synaptic Currents
Excitatory/Inhibitory Current: Positive/Negative charge resulting from the difference in extra and intracellular space.|Leak Current: Current which leaves the intracellular space before reaching the soma.
Action Potential Components
Action potentials are all or nothing operations which have four components which take place over the course of 1-2 ms:||Depolarization|Overshoot|Repolarization/Hyperpolarization|Refactory Period
Myelination
Some axons are covered by a myelin sheet which acts as an electrical insulator. This helps increase propagation speed, reduces energy costs and is what makes white matter white.
Synapses
Each neuron has on average 10^4 synapses. These synapses connect to dendrites to give local input, the soma to give a global input and to axons to allow for output. A Neuron needs ~25 inputs to fire which may be a result of temporal and spatial summation.
Human brain mass and energy consumption
2% of mass 20% of energy consumption
Chemical currents of Chloride, Potassium and Sodium
Chloride: -65mV, Potassium: -90mv, Sodium: 55mV. The latter two are sent out during action potentials.
Membrane Potential
Vm = Vi - Vo
Nernst Equation
K+ Equilibrium Potential := E_k = (RT)/(zF) ln (K+outside/K+inside) â‰ˆ 58/z * log_10 (K+outside/K+inside)
Action Potential Chemical Changes
Natrium increases quickly until inactivation kicks in and it decreases again. K+ increases more slowly and only decreases once the voltage has decreased. The threshold for an AP is where the inward Na+ current exactly balances the outward K+ current.
Hebb's Postulate
may be summarised as: "Neurons that fire together wire together"
Pavlovian Conditioning
Given a reaction to some stimulus A, that reaction can be achieved by stimulating continuously and simultaneously with A and some other stimulous B until eventually A can be removed without changing the reaction.
NMDA Synapse
NMDA Synapses can work as coincidence detectors for pre and postsynaptic firing. Calcium receptors are critical for such synapses. Strong NMDA receptor activations should result in potentiation and weak activations in depression.
LTP and LTD acronyms
Long term potentiation and long term depression
LTP Properties
Long term potentiation has the following properties:|For LTP to occur, both the synapse and the post-synaptic neuron must simultaneously be depolarized beyond a threshold.|LTP is input specific: LTP can enhance the synaptic effectiveness of a synapse without affecting other synapses in the cell. This specificity is largely due to the compartmentalization offered by dendritic spines, and greatly increases the storage capacity of individual neurons.|LTP is cooperative: weak stimulations in single pathways can cooperatively induce LTP.|LTP is associative: weak stimulation in pathways, when coupled with strong stimulation in other pathways, can induce LTP.|Stimuli must be delivered at high frequency, because the post-synaptic cell must be depolarized past a certain threshold for LTP to occur.|LTP has a transient early (lasting 1-3 hours) phase, followed by a consolidated later phase (at least 24 hours). In the early phase the conductance of the post synaptic site is enhanced without the need for new protein synthesis. The later phase does require new protein and RNA synthesis, which results in the construction of new presynaptic active zones and postsynaptic receptors.
STDP
Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity|Not only correlation, but also timing of spikes determines plasticity. Interplay of NMDA receptors and backpropagating action potential is believed to create timing-dependence of plasticity. Sign of plasticity is determined by local calcium concentration. Postsynaptic spike travels back to the dendritic tree and activates voltage-dependent Ca channels. Presynaptic activity can allow Ca influx through NMDA channels (if postsynaptic part is sufficiently depolarized). If pre-spike is soon afterwards followed by post-spike, NMDA-R activity is supralinearly enhanced by depolarization due to backpropagating spike.
Factors influencing neuron plasticity
Different plasticity in different brain areas|Diversity of neuron and synapse types|Large number of control parameters for plasticity experiments (frequency, timing, postsynaptic voltage, position on the dendrite, ...)|Influence of neuromodulators, calcium, drugs, and various proteins|Long-term vs. short-term effects
Dopamine
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and neuromodular. It is significant for motor processes, for our sense of pleasure or reward as well as for attentional, motivational and emotional states. DA is a rather homogeneous, global population signal. DA activation is related to rewarding stimuli or reward prediction errors.
